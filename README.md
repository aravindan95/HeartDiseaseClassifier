                                                  Heart Disease Classifier

This is a study of machine learning models for heart disease prediction. Dataset used is 'Heart Disease Dataset' from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dependencies:
pandas, itertools, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, keras

How to run:

1) Install the necessary packages. 
2) Run each cell.

This program runs smoothly if dependent packages are installed and cells are run sequentially without missing execution of any cell in between.
